## What is?

Default SCSS, JS and assets for starting new projects

## How

It all runs on gulp and inputs and outputs are configured via the gulpfile.js.
As a default, there are templates bundled with the build and a local server setup from flat files. This is to test elements, and you wont need it in your builds on other projects.

## Render

Run 'gulp' from root

## Test/check elements

Run 'gulp serve' from root
